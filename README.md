A Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA Adder) is a high-speed binary adder that significantly improves performance by computing carry bits in advance.
Rather than waiting for them to ripple through each bit position as in a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA).
It is widely used in computer arithmetic units and ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units) of modern processors to perform fast addition.
